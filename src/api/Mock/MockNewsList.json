All three markets had opened lower.</p> \n<p>Price action was muted as investors await news out of the US. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said investors were focused on Congress's vote to approve the $1.9tn stimulus package and US inflation data due at 12.30pm UK time.</p> \n<p>Inflation numbers \"may reinforce the concerns and qualms\" that have been roiling bond and stock markets over the last few weeks, he said. US bond yields have spiked in recent weeks as investors have bet that stimulus will kickstart inflation and force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The rise in yields has drawn money away from the stock market and into bonds. That dynamic has disrupted the rally for growth stocks that characterised most of 2020.</p> \n<p><strong>WATCH: How to prevent getting into debt</strong></p> \n<p>Wall Street got a taste of the old dynamic on Tuesday as tech stocks surged. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC\" target=\"_self\">^IXIC</a>) closed up 3.8% on Tuesday and Tesla (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">TSLA</a>) rose close to 20% to record its best day since February 2020.</p> \n<p>\"Treasury yields pulled back yesterday, as a bid came into the bond market, giving equities room to breathe, and room to rally, especially the under-pressure tech sector,\" said Michael Brown, a senior market analyst at foreign exchange broker Caxton.</p> \n<p>\"Still, we are always in danger of taking each day in isolation in this business, and the broader landscape is important. Growth stocks are still sharply underperforming their value counterparts, the market remains optimistic about the economic reopening, and the bias for yields over the near-term remains to the upside.\"</p> \n<p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/hsbc-sme-fund-2021-15-bn-covid-19-disruptive-entrepreneurship-000132839.html\" target=\"_self\"><strong>HSBC launches Â£15bn fund to support COVID recovery</strong></a></p> \n<p>Futures were pointing to a mixed open in New York later today. S&amp;P 500 futures (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF?p=ES%3DF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">ES=F</a>) were flat, Dow Jones futures (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/YM%3DF?p=YM%3DF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">YM=F</a>) were up 0.3%, and Nasdaq futures (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/NQ%3DF?p=NQ%3DF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">NQ=F</a>) were down 0.3%.</p> \n<p>Sentiment was weak in Asia overnight. Japan's Nikkei (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EN225?p=%5EN225\" target=\"_self\">^N225</a>) closed flat, the Hong Kong Hang Seng (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EHSI?p=%5EHSI\" target=\"_self\">^HSI</a>) rose 0.4%, and China's Shanghai Composite (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/000001.SS?p=000001.SS\" target=\"_self\">000001.SS</a>) was flat. The KOSPI (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EKS11?p=%5EKS11&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">^KS11</a>) fell 0.6% in South Korea.</p> \n<h2>WATCH: Biden's $1.9thn COVID stimulus bill close to becoming law</h2> \n<p></p>",

House and Senate Republicans have unanimously opposed the package as bloated, crammed with liberal policies and heedless of signs the dual crises are easing.</p> \n<p>âIt's a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday. </p> \n<p>For Biden and Democrats, the bill is essentially a canvas on which they've painted <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-coronavirus-relief-package-d794c3e29056cc5f20ab531d978be40c\">their core beliefs</a> â that government programs can be a benefit, not a bane, to millions of people and that spending huge sums on such efforts can be a cure, not a curse. The measure so closely tracks Democrats' priorities that several rank it with the top achievements of their careers, and despite their slender congressional majorities there was never real suspense over its fate.</p> \n<p>They were also empowered by three dynamics: their unfettered control of the White House and Congress, polls showing robust support for Biden's approach and a moment when most voters care little that the national debt is soaring toward a stratospheric $22 trillion. Neither party seems much troubled by surging red ink, either, except when the other is using it to finance its priorities, be they Democratic spending or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2d9e099660064f2b8a8fc2237b4e7e4e\">GOP tax cuts</a>. </p> \n<p>A dominant feature of the bill is initiatives making it one of the biggest federal thrusts in years to assist lower- and middle-income families. Included are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-midterm-elections-poverty-coronavirus-pandemic-elections-9651ead860f014595d06a787861718e5\"> expanded tax credits over the next year for children</a>, child care and family leave plus spending for renters, feeding programs and people's utility bills.</p> \n<p> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-personal-taxes-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-local-governments-e828c92fbdd7f4fa1e35d9ab95fe705e\">The measure </a> provides up to $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, extended emergency unemployment benefits and hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, state and local governments and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls. There is aid for farmers of color and pension systems, and subsidies for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-health-care-reform-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-medicaid-326ce72c76e3d2d99da89d3834f4e8b0\">consumers buying health insurance </a> and states expanding Medicaid coverage for lower earners.</p> \n<p>Its very expansiveness is a chief GOP talking point.</p> \n<p>âIt's not focused on COVID relief. It's focused on pushing more of the far-left agenda,\" said No. 2 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.</p> \n<p>The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last week that 70% of Americans back Bidenâs response to the virus, including a hefty 44% of Republicans. </p> \n<p>Yet the bill's pathway has underscored Democrats' challenges <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/20685c35e31aff0cdbc432d8f127ee62\">as they seek to build a legislative record</a> to persuade voters to keep them running Congress in next year's elections. </p> \n<p>Democrats control the Senate, split 50-50, only because Vice President Kamala Harris gives them the winning vote in tied roll calls. They have just a 10-vote advantage in the House.</p> \n<p>That's almost no wiggle room for a party that ranges from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on the conservative side to progressives like Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p> \n<p>Progressives had to swallow big concessions in the bill to solidify moderate support. The most painful was dropping the House-approved federal minimum-wage increase to $15 hourly by 2025. </p> \n<p>Moderates forced tightened eligibility for the $1,400 stimulus checks, now phased out completely for individuals earning $80,000 and couples making $160,000. The House's initial extension of the soon-to-end $400 weekly emergency jobless payments, paid on top of state benefits, was trimmed by the Senate to $300 and will now halt in early September. </p> \n<p>Manchin was a leading holdout and in the middle of talks that resulted in curbing all of those initiatives. The Senate approved the bill on a party-line 50-49 vote on Saturday. </p> \n<p>Dropping the minimum-wage boost was âinfuriating,â said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the roughly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus. But she called the overall bill âincredibly bold,â adding, \"It hits all of our progressive priorities â putting money in peopleâs pockets, shots in arms, unemployment insurance, child care, schools.â</p> \n<p>The independent Tax Policy Center said that the Senate-passed bill would give almost 70% of this year's tax breaks to households earning $91,000 or less. In contrast, the Trump-era GOP tax bill gave nearly half its 2018 reductions to the top 5% of households earning around $308,000, said the research center, which is run by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. </p> \n<p>Yet keeping Democrats united won't get easier as the party tries advancing the rest of its agenda. There are fault lines within the party over priorities like immigration, health care and taxes. </p> \n<p>At some point it seems likely that progressives will draw their own lines in the sand. They are already demanding that the party revisit the minimum-wage boost, and amid all this Republicans are already demonstrating they are ready to pounce. </p> \n<p>The American Action Network, tied to House GOP leaders, said it's launched digital ads in mostly moderate districts calling the relief bill âa freight train of frivolous spending to bankroll their liberal cronies.â </p> \n<p>The bill passed the Senate under budget rules that prevented Republicans from launching filibusters, which require 60 votes for most measures. That process won't be available for much legislation moving forward, but either way any Democratic Senate defections will make most bills there non-starters.</p> \n<p>Even with their procedural advantage, Democrats' avenue to victory in the Senate was pockmarked with delays. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced clerks to spend nearly 11 hours reading the entire 628-page bill; negotiations with Manchin over jobless benefits lasted around nine hours; and votes on three dozen amendments, virtually all fated in advance to lose, took about 12 hours more.</p>",

                "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. is punishing investment firms that kept payments the bank accidentally sent to Revlon Inc. lenders by blocking them from certain new debt offerings led by the bank, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The bank is choosing to not invite these money managers, who hung on to over $500 million, to its new-issue debt deals, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter.

                "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese bike-sharing giant Hello Inc. has confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter, joining a wave of technology firms seeking to take advantage of surging valuations to sell shares.Hello, backed by Ant Group Co., has started gauging investor demand recently after submitting its filing in the U.S., the people said, asking to not be identified discussing private information. The startup is working with China International Capital Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley for the listing, according to the people.The company has yet to decide the size and valuation of the IPO, though IFR has reported that it was examining plans to raise as much as $1 billion.

Roughly $3.6 trillion of new government paper was issued in 2020 versus $2.9 trillion the year prior, according to SIFMA. With President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal package on the docket, issuance in 2021 is slated to rise to $4 trillion this year, according to ING. </p> \n<p> Ballooning supply and weak demand at an auction of seven-year notes in late February helped send the 10-year yield more than 20 basis points higher, with spillover volatility in the equity market. That has put investors on watch for Wednesday's auction https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2021/A_20210304_6.pdf of $38 billion in 10-year notes at 1 p.m. EST. </p> \n<p> \"I think (the 10-year) auction will have a significant impact on sentiment over the next few weeks,\" said Gregory Whiteley, portfolio manager at DoubleLine. </p> \n<p> Analysts at NatWest wrote in a note that the 10-year and subsequent 30-year auction - scheduled on Thursday - could cause \"another mid-week surge in yields.\" </p> \n<p> An auction on Tuesday of $58 billion in U.S. three-year notes went \"not so well as to warrant any rethink\" on the 10-year auction, said NatWest. </p> \n<p> A move higher in yields could also prompt a comment from the Federal Reserve, which holds its next policy-setting meeting on March 16-17. </p> \n<p> \"If the market runs too far ahead of itself, I would expect (the Fed) to have to say something ... to cap rates from going too much higher,\" said David Norris, head of U.S. credit at TwentyFour Asset Management. </p> \n<p> Whiteley said another 20-basis-point move higher in the 10-year yield is possible in the next week or two if demand at auction is weak. </p> \n<p> Among the tools the Fed has at its disposal are an increase in its Treasury purchases and an extension of a regulatory break on a rule called the supplementary leverage ratio, which would allow banks to maintain current holdings of Treasuries. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell in an interview with the Wall Street Journal brushed off concerns about higher yields. </p> \n<p> \"If the auctions go well, this could be a sign to the Fed that rates are increasing for all the right reasons,\" said Meghan Swiber, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America, adding that with a fair amount of demand at auctions the Fed might not \"necessarily need to step in.\" </p> \n<p> Key to the performance of Wednesday's auction is demand from investors in Japan - the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt securities, according to Treasury Department data - as investors square away positions ahead of the March 31 year end. Some of the weak demand at the seven-year auction was due to less buying from Japan, said Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. </p> \n<p> \"The same dynamic holds this week for the 10-year auction this week,\" he said. </p> \n<p> But a further rise in yields following the auction could ultimately entice those investors back into the market and cap the rise in rates. </p> \n<p> \"We think that as rates increase we could actually have Japanese investors and pension funds step in at these levels because Treasury yields do look really attractive relative to their local alternatives,\" Swiber said. </p> \n<p> (Reporting by Kate Duguid; editing by Megan Davies and Leslie Adler) </p>",

(https://bit.ly/2OEew3C) </p> \n<p> The firm said in its filing it will be looking for targets to acquire in one of Virgin Group's core sectors, namely travel and leisure, financial services, health and wellness and renewable energy, among others. </p> \n<p> Branson, a serial entrepreneur and a prolific investor, has raised hundreds of millions through multiple blank-check companies so far. </p> \n<p> In February, VG Acquisition Corp, one of Branson's SPACs, agreed to take consumer DNA-testing firm 23andMe public through a merger, valuing the merged entity at $3.5 billion. </p> \n<p> SPACs are shell companies which raise funds to acquire a private company with the intent of taking it public through a merger at a later date, allowing such companies to enter public markets by sidestepping a traditional IPO. </p> \n<p> Credit Suisse is the sole book-running manager for the Virgin Group Acquisition Corp III offering. </p> \n<p> (Reporting by Sohini Podder in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) </p>",

On the peer-to-peer front, banks have only been competitive through the Zelle collaboration, competing with PayPal, Venmo (owned by PayPal), and Square.</p> \n<p>â</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/ethan-wolff-mann\" target=\"_self\"><strong><em>Ethan Wolff-Mann</em></strong></a><em> is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.

She also revealed that certain members of the family raised \"concerns\" over the color of her unborn child's skin tone.</p> \n<p>Buckingham Palace released a statement on behalf of Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday, writing in part, \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan\" â adding that \"the issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning\" and will be \"taken very seriously.\"</p> \n<p>Among other surprising disclosures, Prince Harry revealed that shortly after announcing their departure, the couple was cut off financially and lost their security detail.</p> \n<p>\"From my perspective, I just needed enough money to pay for security to keep my family safe,\" Princess Diana's youngest son told Winfrey in the interview.</p> \n<p>Although the Duke of Sussex did not specify the exact amount, Kent Moyer, chief of The World Protection Group, told <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2021/03/07/meghan-markle-tells-oprah-winfrey-its-nothing-like-what-it-looks-like/?sh=3ef7504772f1&amp;utm_campaign=socialflowForbesMainTwitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=ForbesMainTwitter\" target=\"_self\">Forbes</a> that around-the-clock security could add up to as much as $4 million a year.</p> \n<h2><strong>Over $100 million</strong></h2> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8066ae30-8103-11eb-9acd-9c9af84e15fd\" alt=\"Harry revealed he was cut off financially from royal family: I needed enough money \" data-uuid=\"19bce56b-6060-3817-8cee-23d3349acede\">\n <figcaption>\n  Harry revealed he was cut off financially from royal family: I needed enough money \"to keep my family safe\"\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Dominic Lipinski - PA Images via Getty Images\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>At the moment, the couple is living off of Harry's $10 million inheritance from the late Princess Diana before eventually earning income from various streaming deals.</p> \n<p>Most recently, the duo signed a 3-year podcast deal with Spotify (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT/\" target=\"_self\">SPOT</a>) for an estimated $15 million to $18 million â but it was their 5-year Netflix (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/\" target=\"_self\">NFLX</a>) deal that's generated the most buzz. Multiple reports said the deal could be valued at up to $100 million.</p> \n<p>Still, the cost of being a royal is much higher â with U.K. taxpayers supporting a significant portion of the monarchy's finances. The latest <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/financial-reports-2019-20\" target=\"_self\">Sovereign Grant account</a> revealed that the UK monarchy cost Â£69.4 million (roughly $96 million today) between 2019-2020 â up modestly from the previous year's level of Â£67 million (~$93 million)</p> \n<div></div> \n<p>The Sovereign Grant, funded in part by British taxpayers, is used to support the official duties of the monarch, including travel, security, staff and building upkeep.</p> \n<p>Its value is determined by how much money the Crown Estate â the family's massive portfolio of real estate properties â has brought in.</p> \n<p>Over 2019 to 2020, that total amounted to Â£82.4 million (~$114 million). The monarchy spent Â£69.4 million of that on official duties, including Â£21.2 million (~$29.5 million) on Buckingham Palace renovations.</p> \n<p>For Harry and Meghan, access to the Sovereign Grant accounted for 5% of their total income. The other 95% lied in the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate account maintained by Prince Charles. The estate is valued at roughly $1.2 billion, with Prince Charles receiving approximately $28.3 million to distribute amongst his family.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/style/harry-meghan.html\" target=\"_self\">The New York Times </a>has reported both Prince Harry and Prince William received an estimated $6.4 million from Prince Charles and the Duchy, although the exact number is still unknown. Still, the couple no longer have access to either fund, according to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/meghan-markle-prince-harry-no-longer-getting-money-prince-charles-1530011\" target=\"_self\">multiple reports.</a></p> \n<p><strong><em>Alexandra is a Producer &amp; Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.

                "content": "<p>Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 will boost wages for 32 million workers in America, a new report says.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/\" target=\"_self\">report</a>, published by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI), found that an increase in the minimum wage would affect 22.1 million workers directly, and 10.1 million workers indirectly, by the year 2025 â and together would constitute 21% of the projected U.S. workforce in that year.</p> \n<p>According to EPI's estimates, 22.1 million workers would directly see a benefit from the hike since they would otherwise be earning less than $15 an hour in 2025, and 10.1 million would benefit indirectly as they'd be earning just above $15 an hour by 2025.</p> \n<p>Previous <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/biden-stimulus-federal-minimum-wage-134146222.html\" target=\"_self\">research</a> from the UC Berkeley Labor Center reached roughly the same estimates, expecting 23 million workers to see a \"direct boost\" in pay.</p> \n<p>On average, an affected low-wage worker would see an annual pay increase of more than $3,300, EPI estimated.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8130bb50-810b-11eb-beff-ac3a288aaad2\" alt=\"(Screenshot: Economic Policy Institute)\" data-uuid=\"7cf70636-b823-3168-9b58-a2f811410c91\">\n <figcaption>\n  (Screenshot: Economic Policy Institute)\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2><strong>'It makes great business sense'</strong></h2> \n<p>Part of the 32 million who would see an increase in pay includes those in \"critical infrastructure\" jobs, such as in healthcare, energy, and transportation.</p> \n<p>And the hike would disproportionately benefit Black and Hispanic workers â and women â the authors said. Earnings would rise for nearly one in three Black workers, and one in four Hispanic workers. Only one in five white workers will see a boost in wages, in comparison.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a wage increase would lift 3.7 million people out of poverty, EPI stated.</p> \n<p>That estimate is higher than a separate <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbo-15-minimum-wage-hike-would-cost-14-m-jobs-lift-900-k-out-of-poverty-170900012.html\" target=\"_self\">report</a> by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO said that while the wage hike would cost 1.4 million jobs by 2025, 900,000 people will be lifted out of poverty with a $15-an-our federal wage. (It's also worth noting that the CBO is <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf\" target=\"_self\">more conservative</a> in its estimates of how many workers would benefit directly and indirectly from a wage increase, placing that number at 27 million.)</p> \n<p>For many workers, an increase to $15 would have a significant impact on their day-to-day finances. \"I work 20 hours a week, my take-home pay is about $200, after paying rent, electric, phone bill and transportation and ... food and medication ... it's really a struggle and I'm working from paycheck to paycheck,\" Tracey Thuo, a 59-year-old worker Wilmington, Del., said at a <a href=\"https://zoom.us/rec/play/sSXUDAv5-Wvr4Zev9mHRiVIaGqCMKHWiPnlhSPRrwpFEO-odbY6_QrmoEx_s96-4I7GtuLXmUyldIN36.2ooPr8V1hRYZGSGk?continueMode=true&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=DnzfIG2vT9WwH54nNp5MAA.1615317974397.4a2eff13869c841db25c0239f390eecc&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=70\" target=\"_self\">press conference earlier this week</a>, organized by Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a coalition of groups that support of a $15 minimum wage.</p> \n<p>Thuo is a member of the 32BJ Service Employees International Union, and cleans a building on Market Street. A \"$15 minimum wage means a lot for all of us... [and] will make a big difference in my life,\" she added.</p> \n<p>A handful of big retailers have already <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retailers-raising-wages-173331229.html\" target=\"_self\">moved to raise their employees wages</a> to $15 an hour and above, namely Target, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-costco-pays-its-180000-workers-way-more-than-the-minimum-wage-120358716.html\" target=\"_self\">Costco</a> and Best Buy. Some smaller <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-15-federal-minimum-wage-could-affect-hiring-trends-inflation-morgan-stanley-203057861.html\" target=\"_self\">businesses</a> support a hike as well. \"It makes great business sense,\" Delaware-based Courtney Sunborn, who owns Ecolistic Cleaning, said during the press conference. \"I want all of the employees to feel valued for their hard work.\"</p> \n<p>She explained that by paying her workers a minimum of $14.50 an hour â and soon $15 an hour this year â \"we've seen that it increases both employee commitment and reliability, but also decreases turnover. And turnover has proven for me to be so expensive,\" Sunborn said.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/minimum-wage-15-why-good-141425817.html\" target=\"_self\">current federal minimum wage</a> has been at $7.25 an hour since 2009. Many parts of the country have already raised the minimum wage, reflecting local market pressures and workers' needs.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/8271fed0-5040-11eb-bd77-cc2680ea6f3d\" alt=\"(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\" data-uuid=\"4111c39b-1b07-34de-998b-e92c6fea66f4\">\n <figcaption>\n  (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>This includes <a href=\"https://money.yahoo.com/minimum-wage-15-florida-passes-200417596.html\" target=\"_self\">Republican-leaning states like Florida</a>. By 2022, three more states will have hourly wages beyond $10.</p> \n<p>While President Joe Biden and some progressive lawmakers tried to include a $15 federal minimum wage hike in the $1.9 trillion stimulus package expected to pass this week, congressional rules <a href=\"https://money.yahoo.com/progressive-democrats-pressure-biden-to-overrule-on-minimum-wage-154206801.html\" target=\"_self\">prevented the wage hike from</a> being included in the budget reconciliation bill.</p> \n<p>EPI noted that 24 million of the workers who would see an increase in wages from a hike live in <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-by-congressional-district/\" target=\"_self\">states</a> represented by the 58 senators who voted <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-better-way-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-123520433.html\" target=\"_self\">against the minimum wage increase</a>.</p> \n<p>For instance, in Arizona â Sen. Krysten Sinema's state â around a quarter of the state's workers would be affected by the hike. Sinema, a Democrat, had <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/05/kyrsten-sinema-thumbs-down-minimum-wage-hike-compared-john-mccain/4603069001/\" target=\"_self\">voted against the</a> amendment last week.</p> \n<p>Some Democratic lawmakers have since then urged Biden to overrule the parliamentarian's decision.</p> \n<p>\"Without a higher minimum wage, a lot of workers... they're working two or three jobs... just to literally put food on their tables, so it's just a shame,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) told Yahoo Finance Live. But the fight isn't over, she added.</p> \n<p>Most Americans <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/83-of-americans-say-725-hour-minimum-wage-is-not-enough-poll-184507957.html\" target=\"_self\">favor</a> raising the federal minimum wage, which was last increased in 2009.</p> \n<p>â</p> \n<p><em>Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In the Northeast, Connecticut â <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/gov-ned-lamont-defends-easing-covid-restrictions-in-connecticut.html\" target=\"_self\">one of the hardest hit states</a> â has also come in for criticism after relaxing many of its coronavirus restrictions.</p> \n<p>âI donât understand that,â Meghan Fitzgerald, a health care policy professor at Columbia University, recently said on Yahoo Finance Live.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>âI donât know why you canât wait just a little longer to get these numbers up, especially with Johnson &amp; Johnsonâs vaccine now being put out there. I donât know why we canât just wait another four weeks. Weâve waited a year â whatâs another few weeks?â she asked.</p> \n<p>Now that Johnson and Johnson (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ?p=JNJ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">JNJ</a>)âs COVID-19 shot has <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jj-single-dose-covid-19-vaccine-recommended-for-emergency-use-220635051.html\" target=\"_self\">received</a> emergency use authorization by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), there are now three different vaccines available for public use, along with Pfizer (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE?p=PFE&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">PFE</a>)âs and Moderna (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MRNA?p=MRNA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_self\">MRNA</a>)âs.</p> \n<div></div> \n<p>And though 87 million doses have been given so far, that only accounts for just over 17% of the U.S. population â putting the country sixth overall, behind Israel, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Chile, and Bahrain.</p> \n<p>Plus, Fitzgerald noted, âonly 9% of the [U.S.] population has received both doses. So the progress state by state is really what you have to look at. I think thereâs still room for efficiency and, certainly, equity.â</p> \n<h2><strong>'There's still some work to go'</strong></h2> \n<p>So far, Montana, Iowa, North Dakota, and Mississippi <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2020/states-mask-mandates-coronavirus.html#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20four%20states%20that,old%20mask%20order%20will%20expire.\" target=\"_self\">have lifted</a> their statewide mask mandates.</p> \n<p>And on March 10, Texas <a href=\"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-lifts-mask-mandate-opens-texas-100-percent\" target=\"_self\">will become</a> the fifth following Governor Greg Abbottâs order to fully reopen the state and lift all restrictions, despite the fact that the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/texas\" target=\"_self\">stateâs positivity rate</a> is still at 13.46% and only about 15% of its population has received at least one dose of the vaccine.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/71075800-80fd-11eb-a32f-5bcd174cb01f\" alt=\"AUSTIN, TX - MARCH 03: Pedestrians walk down South Congress Ave. on March 3, 2021 in Austin, Texas.

And weâre also looking at variants. So I think thereâs still some work to go.â</p> \n<p>Over the past week, there has been a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/\" target=\"_self\">15% decline</a> in cases overall in the country. Yet states like Alabama, Vermont, and Arizona, along with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html\" target=\"_self\">some pockets of Texas</a>, have seen a spike in positive cases.</p> \n<p>âWhat Iâve been most concerned about are the seniors, those over age 65, and there are still areas for improvement,â Fitzgerald said. âFlorida has 35% of its seniors vaccinated. But down in Pennsylvania, only 28% of the seniors have been vaccinated.â</p> \n<p>Each state varies in its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\" target=\"_self\">vaccine guidelines</a>. Some states allow those as young as 50 years old to get the vaccine already, while others vary amongst age groups over 55. North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/vaccinating-older-adults-in-the-us-against-covid-19-a-work-in-progress/#:~:text=Among%20adults%2065%20and%20older,long%2Dterm%20care%20facility%20data.\" target=\"_self\">leads the way</a> with almost half of its elderly population receiving at least one dose of the shot, with states like Florida, Arizona, and South Carolina not far behind.</p> \n<div></div> \n<p>Relaxing mask mandates creates a âhuge risk,â Fitzgerald told Yahoo Finance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>âNot all of them are vaccinated. If youâre in a state where you havenât been vaccinated, youâre high risk,\" she said. \"And weâre taking away a mask mandate right now. Youâve got to get to a level where youâre close to herd immunity to start pulling back like that, or youâre putting people who havenât been vaccinated at risk.â</p> \n<p>According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. top infectious disease expert, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa/fauci-says-herd-immunity-could-require-nearly-90-to-get-coronavirus-vaccine-idUSL1N2J411V\" target=\"_self\">between 70-80% of the population </a>need to be inoculated in order for the country to reach herd immunity. However, some public health experts would like to see as much as 90% vaccinated, because of the variants emerging.</p> \n<p>âPersonally, I think we see herd immunity on the back end of the summer,â Fitzgerald said. âIâm not as bullish on the front end, just because of the logistics, just because of the distribution.â</p> \n<p>The vaccine rollout has significantly improved since it first began at the end of 2020. But the issue of <a href=\"https://money.yahoo.com/money-worries-are-holding-americans-back-from-getting-the-vaccine-202739217.html\" target=\"_self\">vaccine equity</a> has posed a challenge in the process.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/bddb1700-80ff-11eb-bfff-ac0535533291\" alt=\"A Florida Department of Health employee helps a senior who is getting the COVID-19 vaccine as people of 65 and over wait in line at the DOH Sarasota COVID-19 Vaccination Clinic in Sarasota, Florida, U.S. January 4, 2021.

This is a global pandemic. The virus doesnât know borders.â</p> \n<p>Along with ensuring that at-risk communities have easy access to getting the vaccine, Fitzgerald also stressed the need for making sure that the elderly have just as fair of a chance, specifically because most of vaccine registration opportunities are online, and many older Americans arenât as adept with technology.</p> \n<p>âIâm most concerned about the seniors,â she said. âIâll remain concerned about the seniors â¦ Most of the seniors over age 65 have been the ones that have really been unfairly targeted by the virus. The highest death rate, 80% of the deaths, still sit at over 65.â</p> \n<p><em>Adriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

Critics pointed to the events as a wake up call that highlighted the inherent risks associated with its technology. Four months after the reactor meltdowns, the German government announced plans to phase out all 17 of the countryâs reactors by 2022, while the Swiss abandoned plans to build new nuclear reactors and committed to phase out existing ones. In Japan, where nuclear power accounted for a third of the countryâs energy mix before March 2011, just nine of its 54 existing reactors have been authorized to operate over the last decade.</p> \n<p>The U.S. remains the worldâs largest producer of nuclear power, with its <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/05/f62/NEGTN02-%23227578-v4-NUCLEAR_INDUSTRY_SCORECARD_SUMMARY.pdf\" target=\"_self\">98 reactors accounting for 20% of Americaâs total electrical output</a>, according to the Department of Energy.</p> \n<p>âFukushima changed everything because it was a real accident in a sophisticated, highly developed country that was known for its safety record...it was not Chernobyl, which had a completely different profile at the time,â Borovas said. âThe whole industry retrenched. Countries around the world retrenched.â</p> \n<p>A decade on, nuclear power capacity has increased by about 43 gigawatts, the equivalent of roughly 43 reactors coming online, according to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power\" target=\"_self\">a report by the International Energy Agency</a>. Though the <a href=\"https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/\" target=\"_self\">number of reactors have declined from more than 430 in 2011, to 414 globally</a>, existing reactors have increased their output to meet demand.</p> \n<p>The growth has been most pronounced in emerging economies, which see nuclear energy as the most sustainable path to meet the energy demands of a growing middle class, Borovas said. In China alone, where ongoing projects account for 20% of reactors under construction globally, the government has identified nuclear power as a key tool in its push to decarbonize. It recently called for the construction of coastal nuclear power plants to increase its energy capacity by 20 gigawatts in the next four years, the equivalent of 20 new reactors.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/bd895eb0-8069-11eb-bbef-03514e1d79bf\" alt=\"NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2020/07/25: Solar photovoltaic power plant farm installation.

Those like the National Resources Defense Council and the Environment Defense Fund now see nuclear as a necessary tool to decarbonization. The Union of Concerned Scientists, an organization that has regularly warned of the dangers of nuclear, has highlighted the risks of prematurely phasing out existing nuclear reactors, only to be replaced primarily by natural gas and coal. A <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2018/11/Nuclear-Power-Dilemma-executive-summary.pdf\" target=\"_self\">2018 study by the group</a> estimated the early closure of at-risk plants would increase the energy sectorâs carbon emissions by 4% to 6% by 2035.</p> \n<p>âThis pathway would make it more difficult for the United States to achieve deep cuts in carbon emissions,â the report said.</p> \n<p>But Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California at Berkeley, said renewable energy offers a better and safer alternative to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Two-thirds of all new energy installations built worldwide last year were in solar and wind, he said. Renewables accounted for <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2020/renewables\" target=\"_self\">nearly 30% of global electricity generation</a> as of April 2020, according to the IEA.</p> \n<p>âSolar and wind are the cheapest forms of energy today. Nuclear can't touch their prices. But when you say I want solar and wind plus storage, nuclear proponents say yeah we'll meet that price and nuclear skeptics say well you've never met price targets in the past,â Kammen said. âRenewables are gobbling up the space that coal used to occupy.\"</p> \n<h2><strong>Future of nuclear energy</strong></h2> \n<h2></h2> \n<p>Concerns about safety and cost overruns continue to plague the industry. But a new generation of reactors, armed with advanced technologies and engineering, promise to address those concerns through small modular reactors or SMRs. Unlike traditional reactors, SMRs require a much smaller footprint and can be scaled up at a faster and cheaper cost because components can be mass produced in factories, according to Borovas. The new reactor designs also donât require the amount of shielding and maintenance the existing ones do. The sheer potential of the technology has already attracted some big name investors, including Bill Gates and the U.S. government, into companies like TerraPower and NuScalet.</p> \n<p>The only problem â no commercial SMR has been successfully launched anywhere in the world, Borovas said. The first modular reactor in the U.S., developed by NuScale, isnât expected to be completed until the end of the decade.</p> \n<p>âIf you look at these small plants as technologically and fundamentally different than large plants, then there's a huge potential building boom for nuclear,â Kammen said. âIf you view these as just compounding the challenges of larger plants, but just having many more of them, then it doesn't look like a road to somewhere because no one has proven yet that these small plants will be fundamentally different in cost and fundamentally safer.â</p> \n<p><strong><em>Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Curaleaf Executive Chairman Boris Jordan said in a statement that the deal would give Curaleaf access to a market that has potential to expand beyond the U.S.</p> \n<p>The consumer and political liberalization trends around cannabis that are sweeping the U.S. are also increasingly taking hold in Europe,\" he said. \"Curaleaf will seek to leverage our branded cannabis consumer packaged goods strategy across Europe, a market which provides for cross-border cannabis distribution. The European cannabis market has the potential to exceed the U.S. cannabis market over the long-term and will help fuel our growth for years to come.\"</p> \n<p></p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/90a4d0f0-e065-11e9-bff3-7697a5db8c71\" style=\"height:2456;width:3735;\" alt=\"View of medical marijuana plants hanging to dry during a media tour of the Curaleaf medical cannabis cultivation and processing facility Thursday, Aug. 22, 2019, in Ravena, N.Y.

Tilray, for its part, has invested heavily into production in Portugal and in 2020 acquired its third so-called Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, certification in the country. Emmac, Curaleaf stressed in its release, boasts a Portugal cultivation facility that is \"an industry leader in cannabis flower production cost.\"</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-companies-continue-their-rally-as-curaleaf-chairman-applauds-quicker-reform-120028344.html\" target=\"_self\">Jordan explained to Yahoo Finance</a> why the company chose to raise a combined $300 million in debt and equity in January to invest in growth as reforms became more likely.</p> \n<p>\"We raised $300 million in order to cash up, in order to have the ability to invest across the country in all of those states and in new states that we think will be coming online and the fact that legalization will be moving much faster. So it was really there in order to prepare the company for what we think will be an acceleration of growth,\" he said</p> \n<p>During the same interview he stressed that the formulated cannabis market, including drinks and edibles, looked more attractive in the long-term.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Zack Guzman is an anchor for Yahoo Finance Live as well as a senior writer covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

                "summary": "Anyone trying to keep track of where the markets might be heading, could be forgiven for displaying signs of dizziness. The markets are being violently pulled in opposite directions lately, making it difficult to form a coherent investing strategy. It is in time like this that some expert advice might provide a clearer picture. Hardly any on the Street come more highly regarded than billionaire David Tepper. The co-founder of global hedge fund Appaloosa Management, Tepper is known for his brash and confident style, traits which could come in handy in todayâs confused climate. Tepper made his fortune â and built his hedge fund â by investing in distressed assets and profiting mightily when markets reversed later on. And with $14 billion worth of assets under Appaloosaâs management, itâs natural for Wall Street to take notice when Tepper has something to say. âBasically, I think rates have temporarily made the most of the move and should be more stable in the next few months, which makes it safer to be in stocks for now,â Tepper noted. The billionaire believes the rising rates should settle and points out that with the Senateâs approval of the coronavirus fiscal stimulus package, it is currently âvery difficult to be bearish.â With this in mind, weâve opened up the TipRanks database to get the scoop on two of Tepperâs recent new positions. These are Strong Buy stocks â and perhaps more interestingly, both are strong dividend payers, with annual yields exceeding 7%. We can turn to the Wall Street analysts to find out what else might have brought these stocks to Tepperâs attention. MPLX LP (MPLX) Weâll start with a long-established name in the energy sector. Marathon Petroleum, one of the giants of Big Oil, operates across the US, in the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, and along the Gulf Coast, moving oil and natural gas products from the wells to the storage and distribution facilities. MPLX has benefited from the general economic reopening in the second half of 2020, with the stock gaining as more people returned to work and demand for fuel increased. Overall, shares are up 98% in the last 12 months. At the top line, revenues have rebounded from a dip in 2Q20, gaining 8.5% to reach $2.17 billion by Q4. Earnings, which turned sharply negative in 1Q20, rose steadily through the rest of the year, and came in at 64 cents per share in Q4. But perhaps the most important metric, for investors, was MPLXâs net cash position â for the full year 2020, the company generated $4.5 billion in cash, and returned over $3 billion of that to shareholders. In its most recent dividend declaration, the company announced a 68.75 cent payment per common share, or $2.75 annualized. This gives a yield of 10.5%, far above the average yield. And David Tepper, in the last quarter, bought heavily into MPLX, picking up more than 3.45 million shares of the stock. At current prices, these shares are now worth $89.77 million. As noted, this is a new position for Tepper, and it is a substantial one. Covering this stock for RBC Capital, 5-star analyst TJ Schultz believes the companyâs strong balance sheet justifies a positive sentiment. â[We] think MPLX is well positioned to continue steady cash flow and distributions into 2021+. Management reinforced MPC's commitment to MPLX contract renewals. Some modest price slippage on near-term barge renewables, but the chunkier contracts were either set more recently (longer runway) or are already tied to FERC oil dynamics. We like MPLX's improving FCF profile and solid balance sheet, which we think gives management more options for returning value through unit buybacks over the next year,\" Schultz wrote. To this end, Schultz gives MPLX a $29 price target, implying a 12% upside, to go along with his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Schultzâs track record, click here) MPLXâs strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price close to the average price target. Shares are selling for $25.92 now, with an average target of $27.67 suggesting room for ~7% further growth. The stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 5 Buys and 1 Hold given over the past 3 months. (See MPLX stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) Sticking with the energy sector, weâll look at another midstream company that caught Tepperâs attention. Enterprise Products Partners, with a $50 billion market cap, is a major player in the midstream segment, and operates a network of assets including more than 50,000 pipeline miles, storage facilities for 160 million barrels of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and shipping terminals on the Gulf Coast in Texas. The story here is similar to that for MPLX. Enterprise was hurt by the lockdowns put in place to combat the COVID pandemic, but in the last six months has seen a rebound in share value and revenues. Shares are up 40% in that time, while revenues in Q4 broke back above $7 billion. Overall, Enterpriseâs 2020 performance showed declines from 2019 â but one important metric showed a gain. Of the companyâs total cash flow, $5.9 billion, $2.7 billion was free cash flow (FCF), or cash available for distribution. This was up 8% year-over-year, and allowed the company to keep up its regular dividend payment â and even to raise the payment in the most recent declaration, from 44 cents per common share to 45 cents. With a $1.80 annualized payout per share, this gives a robust yield of 7.7%. Tepperâs new position in EPD is substantial. The hedge fund leader bought up 1.09 million shares of the stock for his first position, a buy that is now worth $25.23 million. Analyst Matt OâBrien, of JPMorgan, sides with the bulls, reiterating a Buy rating and $28 price target. This target conveys his confidence in EPD's ability to climb 20% from current levels. (To watch OâBrien's track record, click here) âWith capex needs slowing, EPD expects to reach positive discretionary free cash flow in 2H21, enabling fully funding capex, growing cash distributions, and opportunistic buybacks... Overall, we continue to believe EPD offers the optimal mix of offense and defense, with attractive embedded operating leverage, notable barriers to entry, low leverage, and best-in-class financial flexibility,â OâBrien commented. Wall Streetâs analysts can be a contentious lot â but when they agree on a stock, itâs a positive sign for investors to take note. Thatâs the case here, as all of the recent reviews on EPD are Buys, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. The analysts have given an average price target of $27, which indicates ~15% upside from the current share price of $23.38.

Marathon Petroleum, one of the giants of Big Oil, operates across the US, in the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, and along the Gulf Coast, moving oil and natural gas products from the wells to the storage and distribution facilities.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>MPLX has benefited from the general economic reopening in the second half of 2020, with the stock gaining as more people returned to work and demand for fuel increased. Overall, shares are up 98% in the last 12 months. </p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>At the top line, revenues have rebounded from a dip in 2Q20, gaining 8.5% to reach $2.17 billion by Q4. Earnings, which turned sharply negative in 1Q20, rose steadily through the rest of the year, and came in at 64 cents per share in Q4.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>But perhaps the most important metric, for investors, was MPLXâs net cash position â for the full year 2020, the company generated $4.5 billion in cash, and returned over $3 billion of that to shareholders. In its most recent dividend declaration, the company announced a 68.75 cent payment per common share, or $2.75 annualized. This gives a yield of 10.5%, far above the average yield.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>And David Tepper, in the last quarter, bought heavily into MPLX, picking up more than 3.45 million shares of the stock. At current prices, these shares are now worth $89.77 million. As noted, this is a new position for Tepper, and it is a substantial one.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Covering this stock for RBC Capital, 5-star analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/t-j-schultz\">TJ Schultz</a> believes the companyâs strong balance sheet justifies a positive sentiment.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>â[We] think MPLX is well positioned to continue steady cash flow and distributions into 2021+. Management reinforced MPC's commitment to MPLX contract renewals. Some modest price slippage on near-term barge renewables, but the chunkier contracts were either set more recently (longer runway) or are already tied to FERC oil dynamics. We like MPLX's improving FCF profile and solid balance sheet, which we think gives management more options for returning value through unit buybacks over the next year,\" Schultz wrote. </p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>To this end, Schultz gives MPLX a $29 price target, implying a 12% upside, to go along with his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Schultzâs track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/t-j-schultz\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>MPLXâs strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price close to the average price target. Shares are selling for $25.92 now, with an average target of $27.67 suggesting room for ~7% further growth. The stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 5 Buys and 1 Hold given over the past 3 months.

Enterprise Products Partners, with a $50 billion market cap, is a major player in the midstream segment, and operates a network of assets including more than 50,000 pipeline miles, storage facilities for 160 million barrels of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and shipping terminals on the Gulf Coast in Texas.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The story here is similar to that for MPLX. Enterprise was hurt by the lockdowns put in place to combat the COVID pandemic, but in the last six months has seen a rebound in share value and revenues. Shares are up 40% in that time, while revenues in Q4 broke back above $7 billion.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Overall, Enterpriseâs 2020 performance showed declines from 2019 â but one important metric showed a gain. Of the companyâs total cash flow, $5.9 billion, $2.7 billion was free cash flow (FCF), or cash available for distribution. This was up 8% year-over-year, and allowed the company to keep up its regular dividend payment â and even to raise the payment in the most recent declaration, from 44 cents per common share to 45 cents. With a $1.80 annualized payout per share, this gives a robust yield of 7.7%.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Tepperâs new position in EPD is substantial. The hedge fund leader bought up 1.09 million shares of the stock for his first position, a buy that is now worth $25.23 million.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/matthew-o'brien?ref=blog\">Matt OâBrien</a>, of JPMorgan, sides with the bulls, reiterating a Buy rating and $28 price target. This target conveys his confidence in EPD's ability to climb 20% from current levels. (To watch OâBrien's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/matthew-o'brien\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>âWith capex needs slowing, EPD expects to reach positive discretionary free cash flow in 2H21, enabling fully funding capex, growing cash distributions, and opportunistic buybacks... Overall, we continue to believe EPD offers the optimal mix of offense and defense, with attractive embedded operating leverage, notable barriers to entry, low leverage, and best-in-class financial flexibility,â OâBrien commented. </p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Wall Streetâs analysts can be a contentious lot â but when they agree on a stock, itâs a positive sign for investors to take note. Thatâs the case here, as all of the recent reviews on EPD are Buys, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. The analysts have given an average price target of $27, which indicates ~15% upside from the current share price of $23.38.

                "summary": "The recent tech-led rebound seen on the Nasdaq may be short-lived, according to Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School, CNBC reported Tuesday. What Happened: Siegel was less than upbeat on the tech-heavy index, which gained nearly 3.7% on Tuesday to cap the best day since November. Siegel associated higher interest rates and optimism on reopenings that continue to come in the way of growth stocks, according to CNBC. âI donât think theyâre going to do badly. Weâre not going to have a crash like we had 20 years ago at all,â said the professor. âBut I think the outperformers are going to be basically non-tech over the next six to 12 months.â Tech stocks rallied on Tuesday, with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) up nearly 19.6% at $673.58 and gaining 2.32% in the after-hours session. On Tuesday, so-called FAANG stocks comprising of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) were all in the green. Facebook shares jumped almost 4.1% to $265.74, Apple shares were up 4.06% to $121.08, and Amazon shares rose 3.76% to $3,062.85. Netflix shares were closed higher by 2.66% to $506.44. Alphabet Class A and Class C shares rose 1.64% and 1.41% to $2,040.36 and $2,052.70 respectively. Most of these stocks were muted in the after-hours session. Why It Matters: The Nasdaq had fallen into correction territory this week with the Nasdaq 100 falling 11% from an all-time-high recorded a month earlier. Siegel noted the upward march of long-term interest rates has not yet stemmed, as per CNBC. âThe so-called value stocks are going to be sought out for their yield because I think interest rates are still going to be headed much higher here on the long bond,â said the analyst. He forecast the Dow hitting 35,000 in 2021, which is a level almost 10% above Tuesdayâs closing. Siegel remains bullish, except on technology stocks, and said this âstock market still has a way to go up,â as per CNBC.

                "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- A world-beating rally in Chinese stocks has turned into the biggest rout globally, shocking investors with the severity of its reversal and evading state efforts to slow the pace of losses.In just 14 trading days, the nationâs benchmark CSI 300 Index has plummeted 14% from a 13-year high. That compares with a 2.2% drop by the MSCI All-Country World Index. The plunge has wiped out more than $1.3 trillion of value and hammered the holdings of retail investors who piled in at the peak, betting that the new lunar year of the Ox, or bull, would be auspicious. State intervention on Tuesday briefly arrested the tumble, before losses resumed.The CSI 300 rose 1.2% on Wednesday.The question on tradersâ minds now is how far the slump will go, given the CSI 300 is only a couple of bad days away from entering its first bear market in two years, and whether authorities will do more to calm sentiment. The hand of the state has become less obvious since 2018, when the government reportedly liquidated a handful of mutual funds it had formed three years earlier to purchase stocks during a crash.But the government has long acted to ensure Chinaâs financial markets are stable, especially around key events. The ongoing National Peopleâs Congress, a closely watched political pageant used to unveil major policy priorities, is one such occasion. To see such turmoil in markets while the NPC is in session is highly unusual. The last time the CSI 300 lost more than 1% during the annual event was in 2014, and the current pace of losses would be the biggest since 2008.State-backed funds, known as Chinaâs ânational team,â stepped in on Tuesday in order to ensure stability during the NPC, according to people familiar with the matter. A Hong Kong-based trader, who declined to be identified discussing client business, said entities linked to mainland funds were actively buying shares through stock links with Hong Kong Tuesday morning.The efforts were initially successful: the CSI 300 erased a 3.2% drop to gain 0.3% in just over an hour in morning trade. Yet the gauge renewed its decline in the afternoon to close down 2.2% at its lowest level since December, a move that stood out against an upbeat day in global shares. The yuan swung between gains and losses amid the ructions in the stock market before rising 0.2% against the greenback as of 6 p.m. There was no significant impact on Chinaâs local credit market, traders said.The China Securities Regulatory Commission didnât immediately reply to a fax seeking comment on whether state funds were behind Tuesdayâs moves. Large insurers in Beijing and Shanghai bought stocks on Tuesday as the market tumbled, according to a Shanghai Securities News report.To be sure, authorities had in some ways encouraged the recent correction. Officials repeatedly warned of asset bubbles and said that curbing risks in the financial system was this yearâs key policy goal. Their comments came as signs of speculative activity increased: Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co., for instance, had surged 30% in just over a month to be worth more than $500 billion, making it one of the worldâs most valuable stocks.Yet, in a country where the government is paranoid about control, the stock market is a tough beast to harness. Rallies tend to morph into manias, and declines have a habit of spiraling out of control. That suggests that more measures will be taken to prevent the rout turning into a panic in a year where the Communist Party will celebrate its 100th anniversary.(Updates figures throughout, adds Wednesdayâs market move in third paragraph, local media report on insurers in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",

                "summary": "Pharma stocksâ fortunes are reliant on the reviews of their drug candidates. A positive response from the regulators will almost always send the share price soaring. Conversely, a rejection will result in investors hurrying to the exit gates. Unfortunately, for ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), the latter case currently holds true. After the close on Monday, the company announced that the FDA has said it found deficiencies in ACADIAâs supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Pimavanserin - which goes under the brand name of Nuplazidin - for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis (DRP). Shares sunk in the following session by 45%. The FDA was meant to discuss labeling and post-marketing requirements with the company but has said it cannot do so until the company addresses the issues. The problem is that ACADIA has not yet been provided with the reason behind the setback. âWhile the actual deficiencies have apparently not been communicated to the company,â Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan commented. âWe assume they will likely receive a Complete Response Letter for the application on the April 3 Action Date. With limited information, we push out the DRP launch by one year in our base case.â The notification is even more surprising due to the fact it is so late in the process. Whatâs more, Divan says, the application has been granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) as it focuses on a significant unmet medical need. Further adding to the puzzlement, Pimavanserin has already been given the FDAâs nod of approval for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions related to Parkinsonâs disease psychosis, which was another reason for the âlowered risk of surprisesâ ahead of the FDA's decision. With uncertainty hanging in the air, Divan has now lowered the treatmentâs probability of success from 80% to 70% and reduced the price target from $70 to $55. However, following the share price collapse, investors are still looking at upside of 120% from current levels. (To watch Divanâs track record, click here) All in all, most on the Street remain in ACADIAâs corner. The analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy, based on 13 Buys and 4 Holds. At $46.25, the average price target suggests shares will be selling for a 85% premium a year from now.

Salesforce is trading at a sizeable discount to the group and the lowest EV/Sales multiple of all the large-cap software names under coverage. We continue to see risk/reward as attractive at current levels, and are adding CRM to our regional conviction list as we continue to see the company as well positioned to capitalize on digital transformation, sustaining organic high-teens growth.\"</p> \n<p>Rangan also set his Salesforce price target at $315, or 52% above current trading levels.</p> \n<p>Goldman's bold calls on Salesforce and Microsoft are a shot across the bow at tech bears, which have increased in number in recent weeks as the Nasdaq Composite has come under considerable pressure.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2021-122439436.html\" target=\"_self\">The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4% on Tuesday</a> amid continued pressure from rising 10-year yields.

As the end of a quarter approaches, Tesla does its best to ship as many cars to customers in the U.S after fulfilling demand in other parts of the world earlier in the quarter. Now Teslarati has noticed an update on Tesla's website, and delivery dates are looking farther away than before, even with three weeks left in the first quarter. Tesla's most popular vehicle, Model 3, previously had a delivery estimate of two to four weeks that was then updated to \"June.\" Now, the website estimates delivery in a time frame of two to 14 weeks. As for the Model Y, a two-to-five-week delivery window was revised to seven to 11 weeks. This would put delivery closer to the end of the fiscal second quarter rather than the first. Deliveries of the refreshed Model S and X were set to start in February or March, CEO Elon Musk said during the fourth-quarter earnings call, but as of the time of writing there have been no documented deliveries of the refreshed models. Musk responded to Teslarati on Twitter and said there are still some fine details to address. Click here to check out Benzingaâs EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news.

                "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- An investigation into illegal talent poaching by Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Ltd. has revived fears Chinese companies will target Taiwanâs top engineers as their country works to build a world-class chipmaking industry.Investigators descended on the offices of Bitmainâs two Taiwan units and interviewed 19 people Tuesday in a probe into whether the crypto-mining startup had violated local laws, according to Chang Jui-chuan, a spokeswoman for the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office. The Chinese firm, which develops semiconductors for mining and other purposes, is suspected of illegally recruiting hundreds of engineers from Taiwanese firms over a period of three years. Taiwan prohibits firms from China from doing business or recruiting locally without prior approval, a measure intended to limit the influence of its political rival.The accusations against Bitmain spur concerns that Chinese firms will accelerate efforts to hire away Taiwanâs best engineers in a bid to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency. Beijing has pledged to develop its own advanced chip manufacturing in order to dominate future technologies and cut its dependence on $300 billion of annual semiconductor imports.Read more: China to Pour More Money Into Chips, AI and 5G to Catch U.S.Taiwanâs deep pool of expertise revolves around Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the worldâs leading chip fabricator and a supplier to most American tech giants from Apple Inc. to Nvidia Corp. U.S. and European companies like Alphabet Inc.âs Google and ASML Holding NV have set up engineering hubs and research bases to tap local talent.âChinaâs poaching of Taiwanese engineers undermines Taiwanâs semiconductor industry,â said Carol Lin, a law professor at the Hsinchu-based National Chiao Tung University, which is now part of the newly formed National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. âThrough the maneuver, Chinese competitors can learn about Taiwan companiesâ progress. If these engineers bring trade secrets with them, Chinese rivals can have a firm grasp of Taiwan companiesâ past success and failure in technological developments, and this could result in unfair competition and even endanger national security.âBeijing has denied Washingtonâs claims that it demands technology or talent transfers or targets the intellectual property of overseas firms. Bitmain representatives didnât respond to multiple requests for comment.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsBitmainâs actions are suspected of breaching Taiwanâs Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Chang said. An article in the act stipulates that for-profit Chinese firms cannot set up units in Taiwan and conduct business activities -- including headhunting -- without approval from Taiwanese authorities, she added.A separate press statement from Changâs office, while not identifying Bitmain by name, shed light on the allegations. In order to develop artificial intelligence chips, the Chinese startup created a new entity in China with a Taiwanese engineer as chairman. This engineer then recruited colleagues from his former company in Taiwan and formed a headhunting team to set up a research and development center in Taiwan, according to the statement. Chang confirmed the company in the press release was Bitmain.The team offered potential recruits double their existing salaries and advertised openly on Taiwanese job sites, the prosecutors said. The countryâs top chip designer MediaTek Inc., a major rival to Qualcomm Inc., was affected by Bitmainâs recruitment drive, Taiwanâs Apple Daily reported. A MediaTek representative declined to comment.Taiwanese executives have accused Chinese rivals of aggressive poaching for years. In 2018, Taiwanese DRAM maker Nanya Technology Corp. President Lee Pei-ing said some of his engineers were being offered three to five times their current salaries by Chinese competitors. The typical practice was to first lure away a manager who would then go on to recruit more of his former colleagues, according to Lee.Beyond talent poaching, global firms with operations in Taiwan and local officials have accused Chinese companies of technology theft. In 2019, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted five people for leaking tech belonging to German chemical maker BASF SE to Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., while Micron Technology Inc. has sued Taiwanâs United Microelectronics Corp. and its Chinese partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. for stealing trade secrets. Both Chinese companies have denied wrongdoing.Read more: Engineers Found Guilty of Stealing Micron Secrets for ChinaBitmain, the worldâs largest crypto-mining equipment maker, has over the years tried to expand into AI chipmaking to cushion Bitcoinâs volatility, but the strategy divided its management. The company relies on TSMCâs foundry for semiconductor production.(Updates with employment forecast chart)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",

Some Technical Levels to Watch The short-term 15-minute chart above shows that the stock is trading in a channel between the range of $8.50 and $12.50. The chart also shows the stock has been hovering around the $10.50 level for the past 15 days. The short-term chart history shows the stock was unable to break below the $1.50 level or break above the $12.50 for an extended period of time. The daily chart above shows the stock was previously trading above the $12 mark holding as a support level before falling through the level. After the stock showed this level was a place of resistance where it could not get above. The stock fell further to near $9 where it found some support. Now the stock seems to be trending in a channel between the two price levels. A bullish technical trader may like to see a price movement break above a resistance level with a period of consolidation before a further price increase may have the potential to happen. A bearish technical trader would like to see the price fall through the support level with some consolidation below before a further move down may be possible. BlackBerry has a market cap of $5.73 billion and a public float of 555 million shares.

                "summary": "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk added $25 billion to his fortune in just one day, enabling him to close the gap with the worldâs richest person and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. What Happened: Shares of Tesla gained nearly 20% in Tuesdayâs regular session for its biggest jump in more than a year, as tech stocks rallied sharply on Wall Street amid falling bond yields. That resulted in Muskâs fortune rising by $25 billion and leading the gains among tech tycoons on Tuesday. Amazonâs shares rose 3.8%, helping Bezos gain $6 billion on the same day. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezosâ net worth was $179.9 billion, followed by Musk with a net worth of $174.1 billion. The index is a ranking of the worldâs 500 wealthiest people. Why It Matters: Bezos and Musk are engaged in an intense tussle for the top spot on the Bloomberg wealth index. Musk dethroned Bezos as the worldâs richest person in January this year and his fortune touched $210 billion in the same month.

Nevertheless, the gap between the two billionaires is now less than $6 billion. Price Action: Tesla shares closed 19.6% higher at $673.58 on Tuesday and rose almost 2.3% in the after-hours session. Amazon shares closed 3.8% higher at $3,062.85 and added another 0.10% in the after-hours session.

                "summary": "Hi tech is the cool kid of investment sectors, offering an unbeatable combination of cutting edge chic and long-term stock market returns. Itâs understandable; our digital world has clearly passed a point of no return in the integration of tech with our daily lives. Tech companies, whether large or small, are clearly in a position to gain from this trend, offering the products and innovations that will facilitate and expand the growth of our high-tech footprint. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is at the forefront the tech wave. AI systems, which allow machines to learn from experience, adapt to change, and process more information faster than ever before, are powering the evolution of tech. New AI systems are making possible autonomous vehicles, personalizing sales and marketing, and speeding up the networked systems that hold the digital universe together. From an investor standpoint, the companies that are building and using AI systems now are in position for gains in the near future. AI is here, and itâs only going to expand its presence. With this in mind, weâve opened up the TipRanks database to get the scoop on three \"Strong Buy\" stocks, according to the analyst community, which are making profitable use of AI technology, and jockeying for position out of the gate. iCAD, Inc. (ICAD) Weâll start in the medtech segment, where iCAD produces solutions, including advanced image analysis, radiation therapy, and workflow to facilitate early identification and treatments for cancer. iCAD offers a comprehensive platform of hardware and software. The companyâs ProFound AI Risk tool is an integrated platform that streamlines the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer; the VeraLook platform uses similar advanced technology to improve image processing in the detection of colon polyps. Medical technology is in high demand, and iCADâs AI-powered platforms take common diagnostic tools and improve their accuracy. Itâs part of a natural trend in medtech, of greater integration of tools and treatments. The field, like much of the medical industry, is growth, and iCAD reported $10.5 million in revenues for 4Q20, a sequential gain of 47%, which was powered by a 70% sequential gain in product revenue from ProFound AI. Year-over-year, quarterly revenue was up 11%, and the ProFound AI sales, in particular, gained 21%. Covering this stock for Oppenheimer, analyst Francois Brisebois sees ProFound AI as powerful gainer for the company. \"We believe growth investors will be rewarded over the years as ICAD gains further share in a growing TAM by providing transformative AI-driven breast cancer detection products as well as targeted, efficient, cancer therapy solutions (quality over quantity). We believe ICAD represents an attractive vehicle for investors looking for exposure to biotech innovation themes and AI data growth waves. Ultimately, while ProFound AI Risk is in its very early stages of launch, we believe it represents a great example of AI's potential in changing treatment paradigms,\" Brisebois opined. Unsurprisingly, Brisebois rates ICAD an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $27 price target. This figure implies a 63% one-year upside. (To watch Briseboisâ track record, click here) The unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating on ICAD shares shows that Wall Street is in broad agreement with Oppenheimerâs analyst; there are 7 Buy-side ratings on ICAD shares. The $21.57 average price target implies an upside of 30% from the $16.55 trading price. (See ICAD stock analysis on TipRanks) Baidu, Inc. (BIDU) Not every high-end AI stock is based in the US. Shifting our view to China, weâll take a look at Baidu, the Asian giantâs largest search engine. In fact, Baidu is the largest internet search platform in the worldâs largest language, used daily by well over 1.3 billion people. Baidu has a massive userbase, and just because Western and Chinese internet systems arenât interconnected doesnât mean that Western investors should overlook BIDU stock. Baiduâs gains are driven by a series of initiatives. The company benefits, like Google, from placing targeted ads on the search platform, ads that are powered by AI software. In addition, Baidu has been expanding the potentialities of its AI, moving into cloud computing and autonomous vehicles. In the past year, the company has even begun launching an autonomous vehicle system, the 14-passenger Apolong bus, in Guangzhou. In February, Baidu reported 4Q20 earnings and revenues, with slightly mixed results. The top line revenues came in at $4.6 billion, just below the forecast of $4.7 billion, but was still up 12% year-over-year; EPS on the other hand, at $3.08, slipped 25% yoy despite beating the forecast by over 10%. Among BIDU's bulls is Fawne Jiang, a 5-star analyst with Benchmark, who writes: âBIDU is making great strides monetizing new AI initiatives including smart transportation and intelligent driving, which should fuel the Companyâs longer-term growth. We believe BIDU is well positioned to grow into a meaningfully expanded TAM capitalizing on growth opportunities in cloud, smart transportation, intelligent driving and other AI initiatives.â In line with these upbeat comments, Jiang rates BIDU as a Buy, and sets a $385 price target that indicates confidence in a 65% upside potential. (To watch Jiangâs track record, click here) With 14 recent Buy ratings, opposed to only 4 Holds, the BIDU shares have earned a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock is selling for $232.68, and its $343.44 average price target implies ~48% upside from that level. (See BIDU stock analysis on TipRanks) Five9 (FIVN) Letâs look into the cloud now, where Five9 offers a scalable contact center platform using an AI cloud technology. Contact centers have been a successful growth segment in the past couple of decades, and cloud computing has changed the way we use software. AI, by making computers smarter and data analysis faster, more efficient, and more accurate, has revolutionized both; contact centers using AI âsmartâ clouds can track and route calls, process information, and direct callers and service agents to each other faster for better results. In 4Q20, the most recent reported, the company showed 39% year-over-year growth in revenue, to $127.9 million â a company record. EPS, however, was negative, with the loss hitting 11 cents per share. This was an unfortunate turnaround from the 1-cent EPS profit posted in the year-ago quarter. On a more positive note, the company finished 2020 with $67.3 million in operating cash flow, up 31% from the prior year. Also of interest to investors, Five9 on March 4 announced that it has been selected as the cloud computing vendor for CANCOM, a leading UK IT company. The partnership makes Five9 the platform that CANCOM will use to expand its call center services, and gives Five9 a strong foothold in the European market. Weighing in for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Jeff Van Rhee noted, âDigital transformations have been kicked into high gear by COVID and the genie is not going back in the bottle. In addition, FIVN has been very aggressive over the past few years moving to public cloud for the entire stack and layering in outstanding AI capabilities. Demand for AI was noted to be playing an extremely important role in many of the largest dealsâ¦ thereâs little doubt about the momentum, performance, and remaining opportunity for FIVN.â Van Rhee puts a Buy rating on the stock, along with a $215 price target implying a 40% one-year upside. (To watch Van Rheeâs track record, click here) Once again, we are looking at a Strong Buy stock. The analyst consensus rating here is based on 17 recent reviews, including 15 Buys and 2 Holds. Shares are trading for $153.81 and have a $202.31 average price target, making the 12-month upside ~32%.

Year-over-year, quarterly revenue was up 11%, and the ProFound AI sales, in particular, gained 21%.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Covering this stock for Oppenheimer, analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/francois-brisebois\">Francois Brisebois</a> sees ProFound AI as powerful gainer for the company.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>\"We believe growth investors will be rewarded over the years as ICAD gains further share in a growing TAM by providing transformative AI-driven breast cancer detection products as well as targeted, efficient, cancer therapy solutions (quality over quantity).

Shifting our view to China, weâll take a look at Baidu, the Asian giantâs largest search engine. In fact, Baidu is the largest internet search platform in the worldâs largest language, used daily by well over 1.3 billion people. Baidu has a massive userbase, and just because Western and Chinese internet systems arenât interconnected doesnât mean that Western investors should overlook BIDU stock.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Baiduâs gains are driven by a series of initiatives. The company benefits, like Google, from placing targeted ads on the search platform, ads that are powered by AI software. In addition, Baidu has been expanding the potentialities of its AI, moving into cloud computing and autonomous vehicles. In the past year, the company has even begun launching an autonomous vehicle system, the 14-passenger Apolong bus, in Guangzhou.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>In February, Baidu reported 4Q20 earnings and revenues, with slightly mixed results. The top line revenues came in at $4.6 billion, just below the forecast of $4.7 billion, but was still up 12% year-over-year; EPS on the other hand, at $3.08, slipped 25% yoy despite beating the forecast by over 10%.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Among BIDU's bulls is <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/fawne-jiang\">Fawne Jiang</a>, a 5-star analyst with Benchmark, who writes: âBIDU is making great strides monetizing new AI initiatives including smart transportation and intelligent driving, which should fuel the Companyâs longer-term growth.

Here are some technical levels to watch on the chart: The short-term 15-minute chart above shows shares have been trading in a channel over the past 10 days. The bottom of the channel happens near the price of $7.50 as it's an area where the stock has been unable to break for an extended period of time. The top of the channel is near the $11 level. The price has broken above this level shown on the chart but has never been able to hold the level. The long-term daily chart above tells almost the same story as the short-term chart. The potential support and resistance levels are in the same places. The only thing added to the long-term chart is another possible level of support near the $5 level. The $5 level has been support in the past, which could make it act as a support level in the future if the price falls to the level. Bull Vs. Bear: A bullish technical trader would like to see a move over this level with a period of consolidation before the stock may have a further upward move. A bearish technical trader would like to see the stock fall to the support level and break below with some consolidation before a further downward move towards the second potential support level. This trader would also like to see the stock fall below the second support level with consolidation before more downward moves.

                "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-may-repurpose-apple-exclusive-002130889.html",
                "summary": "What Happened: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) may be looking to release its own cryptocurrency mining-specific GPUs, according to reports. AMDâs GPUs were originally manufactured exclusively for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), but a recent announcement from the company communicating a âset of fixesâ to the AMDGPU kernel driver suggests that the graphics card will be repurposed for cryptocurrency mining. Specifically, the GPU no longer supports Video Core Next (VCN) which renders it effectively useless for gamers but an ideal option for cryptocurrency miners. AMDâs move comes after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced their CMP cards, exclusively meant for cryptocurrency mining. The NVIDIA CMP cards are Cryptocurrency Mining Processor cards that will be a line of hardware focused on professional mining, with an emphasis on Ethereum. Why It Matters: Bitcoin and Ethereum mining is a massive industry, with miners on both the blockchains each recording daily revenues of over $50 million a day. Mining companies like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT) have seen their share price rally by over 1000% in the past six months that followed the surge in cryptocurrency prices. The attractive fees to be earned in cryptocurrency mining operations have made the business a lucrative investment for many companies that have been focused on moving into the space. On March 8, Norway-based oil and gas giant Aker (OTCMKTS: AKAAF) announced it would set up its own Bitcoin mining unit. The company would set up a unit called Seetee for its mining operations and will reportedly place all of Seeteeâs liquid assets in Bitcoin. In a letter to the companyâs shareholders, Aker CEO Oeyvind Eriksen stated, âTo get long-term exÂ­poÂ­sure to bitÂ­coin, the abilÂ­iÂ­ty to inÂ­crease that with minÂ­ing, and the chance to creÂ­ate new comÂ­paÂ­nies with some of the brightÂ­est minds in the world, is a once in a lifeÂ­time opÂ­porÂ­tuÂ­niÂ­ty. It would be inÂ­sane not to do it.â See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaCathie Wood Thinks Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies Could Soon Become Part Of Typical Investor PortfoliosMajor Crypto Exchange Coinbase Closes In On Going Public With Pre-IPO Valuation Of 0BÂ© 2021 Benzinga.com.

Low P/E multiples are good base indicators that the company is undervalued and can most likely be labelled as a value stock. Benzinga Insights has compiled a list of value stocks in the technology sector that may be worth watching: Hamilton Beach Brands (NYSE:HBB) - P/E: 8.62 Synnex (NYSE:SNX) - P/E: 9.23 Inpixon (NASDAQ:INPX) - P/E: 0.06 Nortech Systems (NASDAQ:NSYS) - P/E: 9.2 Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) - P/E: 8.97 This quarter, Hamilton Beach Brands experienced a decrease in earnings per share, which was 0.59 in Q2 and is now -0.15. Its most recent dividend yield is at 2.13%, which has increased by 0.18% from 1.95% in the previous quarter. This quarter, Synnex experienced an increase in earnings per share, which was 3.33 in Q3 and is now 5.21. The company's most recent dividend yield sits at 0.92%, which has decreased by 0.34% from 1.26% last quarter. Inpixon saw an increase in earnings per share from -0.21 in Q2 to -0.13 now. Inpixon does not have a dividend yield, which investors should be aware of when considering holding onto such a stock. This quarter, Nortech Systems experienced a decrease in earnings per share, which was -0.05 in Q2 and is now -0.35. Nortech Systems does not have a dividend yield, which investors should be aware of when considering holding onto such a stock. This quarter, Ebix experienced an increase in earnings per share, which was 0.88 in Q2 and is now 0.93. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 0.59%, which has decreased by 0.39% from last quarter's yield of 0.98%. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize.
